## Interview  
Upon receiving the invitation for a one-way video interview for the First Line Service Desk Analyst role at Mercury ICT Holdings Group, I recognized this as an important step in the application process and approached it with a high level of professionalism.
My task was to ensure that I presented myself effectively in a pre-recorded format, which differs from a traditional live interview and requires careful preparation and technical readiness. 
To achieve this I first reviewed the instructions taking note of key requirements such as ensuring a quiet environment, testing my equipment, and checking my internet connection in advance.
I watched the tutorial video provided and also made use of the system testing and practice question to familiarize myself with the platform. I even practiced where wamly has an option to do practice questions then you submit the video once you are done.
I dressed appropriately and ensured I was in a well lit space to make a strong first impression.
As a result of this preparation, I was able to complete the interview confidently and professionally, without any technical interruptions, and was satisfied that my responses reflected both my qualifications and communication skills. 
This experience reinforced the importance of adapting to modern recruitment methods and maintaining composure and clarity, even in less conventional interview formats.
This had led to the company hiring me after this interview!
